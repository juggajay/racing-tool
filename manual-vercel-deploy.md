# Manual Vercel Deployment Guide

It seems the automatic deployment script is not working correctly. Here's how to manually deploy your project to Vercel:

## Option 1: Deploy from GitHub

1. Go to the [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
2. Select your project (racing-tool)
3. Click on the "Deployments" tab
4. Click on "Deploy" button
5. Select "Deploy from GitHub"
6. Choose the repository and branch (main)
7. Click "Deploy"

## Option 2: Deploy using Vercel CLI

If you have Node.js installed, you can try installing and using the Vercel CLI:

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI globally
npm install -g vercel

# Login to Vercel
vercel login

# Deploy the project
vercel --prod
```

## Option 3: Deploy using the Vercel GitHub Integration

If you haven't set up the GitHub integration yet:

1. Go to the [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
2. Click "Add New" > "Project"
3. Select "Import Git Repository"
4. Choose GitHub and select your repository
5. Configure the project settings
6. Click "Deploy"

This will set up automatic deployments whenever you push to the main branch.

## Checking Deployment Status

After initiating a deployment, you can check its status on the Vercel Dashboard:

1. Go to the [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
2. Select your project
3. Click on the "Deployments" tab
4. Find your latest deployment and check its status

Once deployed, your project should be available at: https://horses-rose.vercel.app
