# Vercel Deployment Troubleshooting Guide

If you're seeing a 404 error page on your Vercel deployment, here are some steps to troubleshoot and resolve the issue:

## 1. Check Repository Connection

First, make sure your GitHub repository is correctly connected to your Vercel project:

1. Go to the Vercel dashboard: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Navigate to your project: https://vercel.com/juggajays-projects/horses
3. Click on the "Settings" tab
4. Under "Git", check if your repository is connected
5. If not, follow the instructions in `connect-to-vercel.js` to connect your repository

## 2. Check Deployment Status

Check if your deployment was successful:

1. Go to the "Deployments" tab in your Vercel project
2. Look at the most recent deployment
3. If it shows an error, click on it to see the deployment logs
4. Look for any build errors or issues in the logs

## 3. Check Project Configuration

Make sure your project is configured correctly:

1. Go to the "Settings" tab in your Vercel project
2. Under "Build & Development Settings", check:
   - Framework Preset: Next.js
   - Build Command: next build
   - Output Directory: .next
   - Install Command: npm install

## 4. Check vercel.json Configuration

Make sure your `vercel.json` file is correctly configured:

```json
{
  "framework": "nextjs",
  "buildCommand": "next build",
  "devCommand": "next dev",
  "installCommand": "npm install",
  "headers": [
    {
      "source": "/api/(.*)",
      "headers": [
        { "key": "Access-Control-Allow-Credentials", "value": "true" },
        { "key": "Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "value": "*" },
        { "key": "Access-Control-Allow-Methods", "value": "GET,OPTIONS,PATCH,DELETE,POST,PUT" },
        { "key": "Access-Control-Allow-Headers", "value": "X-CSRF-Token, X-Requested-With, Accept, Accept-Version, Content-Length, Content-MD5, Content-Type, Date, X-Api-Version, X-API-KEY" }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "routes": [
    { "src": "/api/(.*)", "dest": "/api/$1" },
    { "src": "/(.*\\.(html|js|css|png|jpg|jpeg|gif|svg|ico))", "dest": "/$1" },
    { "src": "/(.*)", "dest": "/$1" }
  ]
}
```

## 5. Manual Deployment

Try a manual deployment:

1. Install the Vercel CLI: `npm install -g vercel`
2. Login to Vercel: `vercel login`
3. Deploy the project: `vercel --prod`
4. Follow the prompts to complete the deployment

## 6. Check Domain Configuration

Make sure your domain is correctly configured:

1. Go to the "Domains" tab in your Vercel project
2. Check if your domain (horses-4tqzpm7bf-juggajays-projects.vercel.app) is correctly configured
3. If not, add it as a domain

## 7. Clear Browser Cache

Sometimes, browser caching can cause issues:

1. Clear your browser cache
2. Try accessing the site in an incognito/private window
3. Try accessing the site from a different browser

## 8. Check for Reserved Paths

Vercel has some reserved paths that might cause conflicts:

1. Make sure you're not using any reserved paths in your project
2. Check the Vercel documentation for a list of reserved paths: https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/projects/reserved-paths

## 9. Contact Vercel Support

If none of the above steps resolve the issue, contact Vercel support:

1. Go to https://vercel.com/support
2. Provide details about your issue, including:
   - Your project name (horses)
   - The error you're seeing (404 error)
   - Steps you've taken to troubleshoot
