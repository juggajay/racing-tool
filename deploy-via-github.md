# Deploying to Vercel via GitHub Integration

Since the Vercel CLI is not installed on your system, we'll use the GitHub integration to deploy your changes to Vercel. This is actually the recommended approach for production deployments.

## Step 1: Ensure Your Changes Are Pushed to GitHub

We've already pushed your changes to GitHub with the following commits:
- "Update all deployment scripts and documentation with correct Vercel URL"
- "Add test page and simple API route for deployment testing"
- "Add deployment troubleshooting guide and test files"

## Step 2: Connect Your GitHub Repository to Vercel

If you haven't already connected your GitHub repository to Vercel, follow these steps:

1. Go to the Vercel dashboard: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Navigate to your project: https://vercel.com/juggajays-projects/horses
3. Click on the "Settings" tab
4. Under "Git", click on "Connected Git Repository"
5. If a repository is already connected, you may need to disconnect it first:
   - Click on "Disconnect"
   - Confirm the disconnection
6. Click on "Connect Git Repository"
7. Select "GitHub" as the Git provider
8. Find and select your repository (juggajay/racing-tool)
9. Configure the build settings:
   - Framework Preset: Next.js
   - Root Directory: ./
   - Build Command: next build
   - Output Directory: .next
10. Click "Deploy"

## Step 3: Trigger a Deployment

Once your GitHub repository is connected to Vercel, any push to the main branch will automatically trigger a new deployment. Since we've already pushed your changes to GitHub, a new deployment should be in progress.

To check the status of your deployment:

1. Go to the Vercel dashboard: https://vercel.com/juggajays-projects/horses
2. Click on the "Deployments" tab
3. Look for the most recent deployment
4. Click on it to see the deployment details

## Step 4: Access Your Deployed Site

Once the deployment is complete, you can access your site at:

```
https://horses-rose.vercel.app
```

## Troubleshooting

If your deployment fails, check the build logs for any errors:

1. Go to the Vercel dashboard: https://vercel.com/juggajays-projects/horses
2. Click on the "Deployments" tab
3. Click on the failed deployment
4. Click on the "Build" tab
5. Look for any errors in the build logs

## Manual Deployment from Vercel Dashboard

If you prefer to manually deploy your changes from the Vercel dashboard:

1. Go to the Vercel dashboard: https://vercel.com/juggajays-projects/horses
2. Click on the "Deployments" tab
3. Click on the "Deploy" button
4. Select "Deploy" from the dropdown menu

This will trigger a new deployment from your GitHub repository.
