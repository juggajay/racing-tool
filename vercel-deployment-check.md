# Vercel Deployment Check

## Important Note

After every task that involves code changes, it's important to check if the deployment to Vercel was successful. This ensures that your changes are actually live on the production site.

## How to Check Deployment Status

1. Go to the Vercel Dashboard: https://vercel.com/juggajays-projects/horses/deployments
2. Look for the most recent deployment
3. Check its status:
   - ‚úÖ **Success**: Your changes are live
   - ‚ùå **Failed**: The deployment failed and your changes are not live
   - üîÑ **Building**: The deployment is still in progress

## Common Reasons for Deployment Failures

1. **Build Errors**: Syntax errors or other issues in your code
2. **Missing Dependencies**: Required packages not installed
3. **Environment Variables**: Missing or incorrect environment variables
4. **API Limits**: Exceeded Vercel's free tier limits
5. **Configuration Issues**: Problems with vercel.json or other configuration files

## How to Fix Failed Deployments

1. Click on the failed deployment to see the error logs
2. Fix the issues in your code
3. Commit and push your changes
4. Verify that a new deployment is triggered
5. Check the status of the new deployment

## Manual Deployment

If automatic deployments aren't working, you can manually deploy:

1. Go to https://vercel.com/juggajays-projects/horses
2. Click on "Deployments" tab
3. Click "Deploy" button
4. Choose "Deploy from GitHub"
5. Select your repository and branch
6. Click "Deploy"

## Deployment Verification

After a successful deployment, always verify that your changes are working as expected:

1. Visit https://horses-rose.vercel.app
2. Test the functionality you just implemented
3. Check for any console errors or unexpected behavior

Remember to check the deployment status after every task to ensure your changes are live!
