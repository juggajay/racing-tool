# Fixing "DEPLOYMENT_NOT_FOUND" Error in Vercel

If you're seeing a "DEPLOYMENT_NOT_FOUND" error when trying to access your API routes, this guide will help you resolve the issue.

## Understanding the Error

The "DEPLOYMENT_NOT_FOUND" error typically occurs when:

1. The specific deployment you're trying to access no longer exists
2. The API route you're trying to access doesn't exist in the deployment
3. There's an issue with the routing configuration in your Vercel project

## Step 1: Check the API Route Implementation

First, make sure the API route is correctly implemented in your project:

1. Verify that the file `src/app/api/unified-racing/route.js` exists in your project
2. Check that the file exports the correct HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.)
3. Make sure there are no syntax errors in the file

## Step 2: Check the Vercel Configuration

Make sure your Vercel configuration is correct:

1. Check your `vercel.json` file to ensure it has the correct routing configuration:

```json
{
  "framework": "nextjs",
  "buildCommand": "next build",
  "devCommand": "next dev",
  "installCommand": "npm install",
  "headers": [
    {
      "source": "/api/(.*)",
      "headers": [
        { "key": "Access-Control-Allow-Credentials", "value": "true" },
        { "key": "Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "value": "*" },
        { "key": "Access-Control-Allow-Methods", "value": "GET,OPTIONS,PATCH,DELETE,POST,PUT" },
        { "key": "Access-Control-Allow-Headers", "value": "X-CSRF-Token, X-Requested-With, Accept, Accept-Version, Content-Length, Content-MD5, Content-Type, Date, X-Api-Version, X-API-KEY" }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "routes": [
    { "src": "/api/(.*)", "dest": "/api/$1" },
    { "src": "/(.*\\.(html|js|css|png|jpg|jpeg|gif|svg|ico))", "dest": "/$1" },
    { "src": "/(.*)", "dest": "/$1" }
  ]
}
```

## Step 3: Redeploy Your Project

Try redeploying your project to create a fresh deployment:

1. Go to the Vercel dashboard: https://vercel.com/juggajays-projects/horses
2. Click on the "Deployments" tab
3. Click on the "Deploy" button
4. Select "Deploy" from the dropdown menu

## Step 4: Check the Build Logs

Check the build logs for any errors:

1. Go to the Vercel dashboard: https://vercel.com/juggajays-projects/horses
2. Click on the "Deployments" tab
3. Click on the most recent deployment
4. Click on the "Build" tab
5. Look for any errors in the build logs

## Step 5: Try a Different API Route

Try accessing a different API route to see if the issue is specific to the unified-racing route:

1. Try accessing: https://horses-4tqzpm7bf-juggajays-projects.vercel.app/api/hello
2. If this works, the issue is specific to the unified-racing route
3. If this doesn't work, the issue might be with your API routes in general

## Step 6: Check for Reserved Paths

Make sure you're not using any reserved paths in your project:

1. Check the Vercel documentation for a list of reserved paths: https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/projects/reserved-paths
2. Make sure your API routes don't conflict with any reserved paths

## Step 7: Try a Manual Deployment

Try a manual deployment using the Vercel CLI:

1. Install the Vercel CLI: `npm install -g vercel`
2. Login to Vercel: `vercel login`
3. Deploy the project: `vercel --prod`
4. Follow the prompts to complete the deployment

## Step 8: Check for Next.js App Router Compatibility

If you're using the Next.js App Router, make sure your API routes are correctly implemented:

1. API routes should be in the `src/app/api/[route]/route.js` format
2. They should export functions named after HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.)
3. They should return a Response object

Example of a correct API route:

```javascript
export async function GET(request) {
  return Response.json({ message: "Hello, World!" });
}
```

## Step 9: Contact Vercel Support

If none of the above steps resolve the issue, contact Vercel support:

1. Go to https://vercel.com/support
2. Provide details about your issue, including:
   - Your project name (horses)
   - The error you're seeing (DEPLOYMENT_NOT_FOUND)
   - The ID from the error message (syd1::ltlrm-1743125840477-6f338f674195)
   - Steps you've taken to troubleshoot
