# Deployment Instructions

It seems that the automatic deployment to Vercel is not working correctly. Here are some options to deploy your changes:

## Option 1: Test Locally

I've created a simple HTML file that demonstrates the progress bar functionality:

1. Open `test-progress-bar.html` in your browser
2. Click the "Start Backtest Simulation" button to see the progress bar in action

This will give you an idea of how the progress bar will look and function once deployed.

## Option 2: Manual Deployment to Vercel

To deploy your changes to Vercel:

1. Go to the [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/juggajays-projects/racing-tool)
2. Click on "Deployments" tab
3. Click "Deploy" button
4. Choose "Deploy from GitHub"
5. Select your repository and branch
6. Click "Deploy"

## Option 3: Use Vercel CLI

If you have Node.js installed:

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm install -g vercel

# Login to Vercel
vercel login

# Deploy the project
vercel --prod
```

## Changes Made

Here's a summary of the changes I made to add the progress bar:

1. **Frontend (src/app/backtest/page.tsx)**:
   - Added state variables for progress and processing stage
   - Added a progress bar component
   - Set up an EventSource to receive real-time progress updates

2. **Backend**:
   - Created a new API endpoint (src/app/api/backtest/progress/route.js) for Server-Sent Events
   - Updated the backtest API to send progress updates at various stages

These changes will provide a visual indication of the backtesting progress, making the user experience better.

## Testing Without Deployment

If you want to test the changes without deploying to Vercel:

1. Install Node.js if you don't have it already
2. Run the following commands in the project directory:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Open http://localhost:3000/backtest in your browser
4. Upload a file and click "Run Backtest"

This will run the application locally and you can test the progress bar functionality.
